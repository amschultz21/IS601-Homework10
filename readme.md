ðŸ§  Reflection

This assignment gave me hands-on experience applying real-world validation and testing practices within a full-stack web application. From a technical perspective, I improved form validation logic using Pydantic schemas and schema-level validators, ensuring secure and user-friendly input handling for fields like password, nickname, and profile URLs. I also explored how to handle edge cases gracefully, and added unit tests that simulate real user behaviors â€” from submitting broken URLs to updating only one field in a profile form.

On the collaborative side, I gained confidence in using GitHub Issues to track progress and make each fix traceable. Documenting and closing each issue helped me organize my development process more clearly. Managing commits, pushing test-driven fixes, and reflecting on peer review practices improved my understanding of how clean development workflows function in a team environment. Overall, this project helped reinforce good habits around validation, testing, and version control that will carry into future API and full-stack projects.
